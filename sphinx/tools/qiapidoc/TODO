Some ideas that would enhance documentation (generated one included).

- Make all types clickable. For example, qi::log::LogStream would have:
    * qi -> qi namespace
    * log -> qi::log namespace
    * LogStream -> qi::log::LogStream class
- Add some options, like :undoc-member: to add undocumented members. Also
  re-ordering of sections and finally filtering them.
- Try to see if \since and \deprecated can be parsed, but it doesn't look like
  easy for \deprecated at least.
- Make it possible to have multiple projects in the same sphinx.
- Try to find another way to do \includename.
- Support embedded dot graphs.
- fix main index?
- fix class brief when function parameters are realllllly long (see
  qi::log::*::log)
- add mscgen support.
